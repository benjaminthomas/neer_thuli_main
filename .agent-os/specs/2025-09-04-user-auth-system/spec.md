# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Authentication & Authorization System
> Created: 2025-09-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive authentication and authorization system for the Neer Thuli water infrastructure monitoring platform that supports invite-only user registration, role-based access control (Field Worker, Supervisor, Admin), and multi-tenancy across web and mobile platforms. The system will ensure secure access management while providing platform-specific user experiences optimized for field operations and administrative oversight.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Invite-Only User Registration**
As an Admin, I want to invite new users via email so that only authorized personnel can access the water monitoring system. The invited user receives an email with a secure registration link, creates their account with strong password requirements, and is automatically assigned to the appropriate organization and role based on the invitation parameters.

**Story 2: Role-Based Field Operations**
As a Field Worker, I want to authenticate on my mobile device and access only the water infrastructure data relevant to my assigned geographic area so that I can efficiently monitor and report on water systems without being overwhelmed by data outside my responsibility. The mobile app provides streamlined authentication with biometric options and maintains secure sessions during field work.

**Story 3: Multi-Tenant Administrative Oversight**
As a Supervisor, I want to log into the web dashboard and view comprehensive reports across all Field Workers in my organization while maintaining data isolation from other organizations so that I can effectively manage water infrastructure monitoring operations. The system enforces strict tenant boundaries and provides role-appropriate data access controls.

## Spec Scope

1. **Invite-Only Registration System** - Email-based invitation workflow with secure token generation, expiration handling, and role/organization pre-assignment during account creation.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - TOTP-based MFA for web users with SMS backup, biometric authentication for mobile users, and recovery code generation for account recovery scenarios.

3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Three-tier permission system (Field Worker/Supervisor/Admin) with granular permissions for data access, user management, and system configuration based on organizational hierarchy.

4. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Complete data isolation between organizations with tenant-aware authentication, session management, and API access controls to ensure secure multi-organization deployments.

5. **Platform-Optimized Authentication** - Web-based authentication with session management and CSRF protection, mobile authentication with biometric integration and offline-capable token refresh for field operations.

## Out of Scope

- Social media login integrations (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Self-service user registration or public signup capabilities
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with enterprise identity providers
- Advanced audit logging and compliance reporting features
- Password recovery via security questions or alternative verification methods
- Integration with external user directories (LDAP, Active Directory)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Authentication System** - Users can register via email invitation, authenticate with MFA, and access role-appropriate features across web and mobile platforms with proper session management and security controls.

2. **Multi-Tenant User Management** - Admins can invite users to their organization, assign roles, manage permissions, and maintain complete data isolation from other organizations using the web dashboard.

3. **Field-Ready Mobile Authentication** - Field Workers can authenticate using biometric methods, maintain secure sessions during offline periods, and seamlessly sync authentication state when connectivity is restored.
