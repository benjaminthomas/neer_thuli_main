# Neer Thuli Mission (Lite)

Neer Thuli is a comprehensive water infrastructure monitoring and project management platform that enables real-time progress tracking with KML-based geospatial mapping and offline-first mobile data entry.

Target users include field teams, supervisors, and managers working on water infrastructure projects. Key differentiator is KML-based geospatial mapping with offline-first mobile data entry, specifically built for water projects. Primary value is transforming construction progress tracking through automated reporting and photo validation, eliminating manual spreadsheets and enabling real-time visibility across distributed sites.
